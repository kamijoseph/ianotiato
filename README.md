☕ Powered by caffeine and curiosity.

## About Me  
I’m Ian — a passionate builder at the intersection of web, data and machine-learning.  
Currently exploring how AI and sustainable development can meet (check my “AI-Sustainable-Development” project).  
🎯 I believe in *“progress through purpose”* — building code that not only runs, but matters.

## My Focus Areas  
- **Web & Full-stack** – HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, responsive UI &UX  
- **Machine Learning & Data Science** – Python, pandas, scikit-learn, prototype → proof-of-concept  
- **Sustainability & Social Impact** – using code to address UN SDG 13 (Climate Action) and related challenges  
- **Continuous Learning & Collaboration** – open source, peer review, shared growth  

## Skills & Tools  
| Category | Technologies |
|----------|-------------|
| **Languages** | `Python`, `JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS` |
| **Frameworks & Libraries** | `Django`, `Flask`, `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow` |
| **Tools & Platforms** | `Git`, `GitHub`, `Linux/Ubuntu`, `VS Code` |
| **Concepts** | Data Wrangling, ML Pipelines, Web APIs, Sustainable Development Goals |

## 📌 Projects I’m Proud of  
- **Mini E-Learning Platform** — A basic web platform built as part of my AI coursework.  
- **AI-Sustainable-Development** — A machine learning solution for predicting carbon emissions (aligned with SDG 13).  
- **Men’s Wellness Hub** — A web dev project focusing on wellness awareness and community support.
